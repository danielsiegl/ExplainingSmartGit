# Chapter 7: Explaining branching and merging

## Summary
In this chapter we try to explain branching and merging for none software engineers.

## For Kids
**Chatgpt Prompt:** Explain branching and merging to a 7 year old as a story

Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there was a group of friends who loved to build treehouses. They worked together on one big treehouse, but sometimes they had different ideas on how to decorate or add new rooms.

***Branching*:** One day, one of the friends, let’s call him Alex, decided he wanted to try out a cool new idea. So, Alex said, "I’m going to build a new room on my own branch of the tree." He didn’t want to mess up what the others were doing, so he climbed onto his own branch and started building there. This is called "branching," where Alex can try out his new ideas without changing the big treehouse everyone else is working on.

***Merging*:** After a while, Alex finished his room and was really proud of it. He showed it to his friends, and they loved it too! Now, they all wanted to add Alex’s new room to the big treehouse. So, they carefully brought Alex’s room down from his branch and attached it to the main treehouse. This is called "merging," where they take Alex’s new ideas and add them to the big project everyone is working on.

And so, the treehouse grew bigger and better, with everyone’s cool ideas coming together to make something amazing!

## For young Teenagers
**Chatgpt Prompt:** Explain it to a 10 year old using a copying machine where you copy a sheet of paper and modify it

Imagine you have a sheet of paper with a drawing on it that you and your friends have been working on. It's almost finished, but you have an idea for how to make it even better. Instead of drawing directly on the original paper, you decide to use a copying machine to make a copy of it. 

***Branching*:** You take that copy to your own table and start adding your new ideas—maybe you draw some extra details or change a few things. This way, the original drawing stays safe and unchanged while you work on your new ideas. This is like "branching." You're creating a new version to experiment with without changing the original.

***Merging*:** After you finish working on your copy, you show it to your friends. They really like the changes you made, and they want to add them to the original drawing. So, you carefully take the best parts of your new version and combine them with the original. Now, the drawing is even better than before, and everyone’s happy with it! This combining process is like "merging," where you take the changes from your copy and add them back into the original.

So, branching is like making a copy to try out new ideas, and merging is when you take those good ideas and add them back into the main project!


**For Adults**
**Chatgpt Prompt:** Explain for adults using a copying machine where you copy a sheet of paper and modify it

Imagine you have an important document that you and your colleagues are working on together. You have some new ideas for it, but you don't want to change the original just yet in case your ideas need tweaking.

***Branching*:** You decide to make a copy of the document using a copying machine. You take that copy back to your desk and start marking it up with your new ideas, edits, or additions. This way, the original document stays untouched, and you can freely experiment with your changes. This process of making a copy to work on separately is similar to "branching" in software development. You create a separate version to make changes without affecting the main document.

***Merging*:** After you're satisfied with your edits, you bring the marked-up copy back to your colleagues. They review your changes and agree that they should be incorporated into the original document. Now, you carefully take the changes from your copy and apply them to the original document. This step is like "merging" in software—combining the updates from your separate version back into the main project.

So, in summary:
- ***Branching*** is like making a copy to work on independently.
- ***Merging*** is bringing your changes from that copy back into the original. 

This way, you can work on improvements without risking the integrity of the main document until you're ready to integrate the changes.
