## Chapter 2: History of Version Control Systems

„The first real version control system goes back to 1972 when a Source Code Control System (SCCS) started getting developed by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell laboratories as a set of commands developed for OS/MVT, and later on UNIX.”

Version Control Systems have come a long way from their early days of manual management to sophisticated tools that support complex, distributed, and collaborative software development. This evolution reflects the growing complexity and scale of software projects, as well as the increasing need for efficiency and collaboration in modern development environments.

### 1. **Early Days: Manual Version Control**
   - **1950s-1970s:** Before automated version control, developers manually managed changes to code. This typically involved saving different versions of files with distinct names or keeping paper records. The lack of automation made this process error-prone and inefficient, especially as software projects grew in complexity.

### 2. **The Advent of Revision Control Systems (RCS)**
   - **1972:** Marc Rochkind developed Source Code Control System (SCCS) at Bell Labs. It was one of the first tools to offer automated version control for managing source code. SCCS used a file-based approach and stored changes as deltas (differences between file versions).
   - **1982:** Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University developed Revision Control System (RCS). RCS improved upon SCCS by offering a more efficient way of storing deltas, specifically using reverse deltas (storing the most recent version as a complete copy and earlier versions as deltas). This system allowed easier branching and merging.

### 3. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**
   - **1986:** The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) was introduced. Built on top of RCS, CVS allowed multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously. It introduced the concept of a central repository and was widely used throughout the 1990s. However, it had limitations in handling branching and merging.
   - **2000:** Apache Subversion (SVN) was developed as an improvement over CVS. SVN offered better handling of binary files, atomic commits (ensuring that changes are applied consistently across all files), and improved branching and merging capabilities. SVN became one of the most popular CVCS tools.

### 4. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**
   - **2005:** The development of Git marked a major shift in version control. Linus Torvalds created Git to manage the development of the Linux kernel after a dispute over licensing with BitKeeper, a proprietary DVCS. Git introduced the concept of a distributed repository, where each developer has a full copy of the entire project history. This approach greatly improved performance, particularly for branching, merging, and collaboration in open-source projects.
   - **2005:** Another important DVCS, Mercurial, was released around the same time as Git. Mercurial was designed to be easy to use and perform well, even with large projects. Although it was not as widely adopted as Git, Mercurial still gained a significant user base.

### 5. **Modern Era and the Rise of Git**
   - **2010s:** GitHub's rise to popularity helped Git become the dominant VCS. GitHub, a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, added features like pull requests, issue tracking, and continuous integration, fostering collaboration and community-driven development. This made Git and GitHub the de facto standards for many open-source and commercial projects.
   - **Other Platforms:** GitLab, Bitbucket, and other platforms also emerged, offering similar functionalities and sometimes adding unique features, such as integrated DevOps pipelines in GitLab.

### 6. **Recent Developments**
   - **2010s-2020s:** Modern VCS tools and platforms continue to evolve. Git has added new features like improved merge algorithms and better performance for large repositories. At the same time, GitHub and GitLab have integrated more DevOps capabilities, blurring the lines between version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and project management.
   - **Adoption Across Industries:** VCS tools are now used beyond software development, including in industries like content creation, research, and data science, where managing the history of complex files is crucial.
