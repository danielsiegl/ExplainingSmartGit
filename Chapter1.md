# Chapter 1: Why do we need  a process for engineering?

## Summary
Trying to explain why we should collaborate on data with structured processes.
## How we worked with paper
In the early days of engineering, data was stored in physical folders. Whenever changes were needed, you would take a portion of the documents, bring them to your desk, and make the necessary iterations and enhancements for your task. Once finished, you'd present your work to your supervisor for approval. Only after receiving approval would your changes be added back into the folder, allowing other engineers to use your updated artifacts for future tasks. It seems straightforward and simple, right?

This process below sounds like version control terminology, but in reality it describes the same as in the old paper best process for altering engineering data.
